FeedHenry Titanium SDK Demo App
===============================

This project is a very simple demo app which demonstrates the use of the FeedHenry SDK within a Titanium project. The setup instructions are documented [here](https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-js-sdk#using-with-titanium-applications).  

The app is a getting started Titanium project with four clickable labels, each illustrating a different `$fh.act` call.  
All the relevant example code is within `Resources/ui/common/FirstView.js`. 
  
To get started using the SDK in your Titanium project, be sure and read the [FeedHenry Titanium SDK Documentation](https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-js-sdk#using-with-titanium-applications).
